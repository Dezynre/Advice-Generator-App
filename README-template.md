## Overview
It was enjoyable for me going about and completing this challenge by myself. It took me only a day. I used the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com) to completete this challenge. Requests are made using JavaScript's Fetch API and everything else is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon
